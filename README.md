# drone-CV

Computer Vision research for Cornell's Aerial Robotics Team. The goal is to give our drone the ability to navigate as well and recognize objects (such as a red circle) which trigger actions (following / approaching the red circle)

## Requirements 

Raspberry Pi 3

## Software Used

The software we will be using:

* FastAi's library, which uses PyTorch

* OpenCV

## Setup and Misc Resources
